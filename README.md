# Introduction
Front End Suites is a collection of pages developed using Frontend Frameworks.
They are inspired by freecodecamp capstone projects and created by me, Andre Tong.
You can find the link to the app below.

# Development
The collect of apps is developed with each using a different combination of React, Redux, Bootstrap, Vanilla CSS to implement.
It is built on Vite using Node.js and managed with NPM. It is deployed on Vercel.

# Full feature list
- It is a Single Page Application using HashRouter for navigation.
- Random Quote Generator features **API calls** to retrieve a list of random quote to display.
- All pages feature responsive design for small to large screen use.
- Handles global state using either Redux or useContext Hook.
- Styling using bootstrap and CSS.

# Calculations
Calculator page evaluates its results in two steps.  
It implements an infix to postfix algorithmn using a stack, and then more easily evaluates the postfix expression again using a stack.

# Known Bugs
- Audio does not play responsively on mobile, hence the drum demo was taken down. Will need to investigate a better way to do this
